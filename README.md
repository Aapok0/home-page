# [Homepage CV developed with Bulma framework](https://aapokokko.fi/v2/index.php)

After finishing my first [website](https://github.com/Aapok0/homepage) I started making new version of a CV website. This time I wanted to use a CSS framework and ended choosing Bulma. I also decided to add some Javascript as I was learning it.

The website is hosted in an Azure VM deployed with this [Terraform architecture](https://github.com/Aapok0/azure-tf-architecture) with Nginx setup by these [Ansibles](https://github.com/Aapok0/homepage-webserver-ansible).
