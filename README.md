# [Homepage CV developed with Bulma framework](https://aapokokko.fi/version2/index.php)

After finishing my first [website](https://github.com/Aapok0/homepage) I started making new version of a CV website. This time I wanted to use a CSS framework and ended choosing Bulma. I also decided to add some Javascript as I was learning it.
