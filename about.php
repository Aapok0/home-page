      <h2 class='subtitle is-size-5 is-size-6-mobile is-family-code'>Current work</h2>
      <p class='block is-size-5-widescreen is-size-6-desktop is-size-7-mobile has-text-left'>
        Not exactly sure what flavor of engineer to call myself. I've studied electrical engineering, computer science and health technology and currently work with system administration and management of DevOps services on a consultancy basis.
      </p>
      <p class='block is-size-5-widescreen is-size-6-desktop is-size-7-mobile has-text-left'>
        The work mostly revolves around solving issues, doing updates, setting up services, administration and operations with a multitude of different tools and technologies. The company offers management of so many of them to the customers so it's not realistic to master all of them, but the ones I've worked with at least to certain extent include Linux servers, Ansible, Terraform, GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Azure, Artifactory, Hashicorp Vault and scripting with Bash and Python.

      <!-- Personal development -->
      <h2 class='subtitle is-size-5 is-size-6-mobile is-family-code'>Personal development</h2>
      <p class='block is-size-5-widescreen is-size-6-desktop is-size-7-mobile has-text-left'>
        On top of learning while doing my job, I've also done some certificates. I got all three Github certificates during the first two months before starting the consultancy work and got Microsoft AZ-104, while working. Now I'm working on AZ-305. On my free time I'm right now trying to work on my development skills with courses and projects that interest me. I'm not trying to move too fast, since I want to learn why I'm supposed to do things I'm taught. I want to know what happens behind the scenes to see the bigger picture, which obviously also helps with my current profession.
      </p>
      <p class='block is-size-5-widescreen is-size-6-desktop is-size-7-mobile has-text-left'>
        I'm currently working on refreshing my Python skills, learning fullstack development with React as the main frontend library and making my Linux workflow better. Much of that work can be seen from my <a href='https://github.com/Aapok0'>GitHub profile</a>. I'm also trying to find any excuses to create more Bash scripts. Though I do want them to have a real purpose so I'm not doing them just for the sake of it. I think what fascinates me with both system administration and development, is the problem solving aspect.

      <!-- Why problem solving -->
      <h2 class='subtitle is-size-5 is-size-6-mobile is-family-code'>Why I enjoy problem solving</h2>
      <p class='block is-size-5-widescreen is-size-6-desktop is-size-7-mobile has-text-left'>
        I've begun to find the reasons why I enjoy problem solving so much, whether it be with programming, math, system administration, networking or any other avenue for it. To me problem solving feels like working as a detective. I'm given a certain set of clues and background information and then sent on a hunt for evidence and a culprit. It can of course be frustrating sometimes and you might end up banging your head against the wall for a while, but cracking a case is an amazing feeling even when it's something small.
      </p>

      <!-- Why health technology -->
      <h2 class='subtitle is-size-5 is-size-6-mobile is-family-code'>Why I directed my studies towards health technology</h2>
      <p class='block is-size-5-widescreen is-size-6-desktop is-size-7-mobile has-text-left'>
        My passion for health related fields flows from my own interest with bettering myself and especially from solving my own health related issues. I've worked as my own personal trainer and physiotherapist for a quite a while now (though I do also consult professionals regularly) and try to use technology to my advantage, whenever I can. I almost ended studying either physiotherapy or podiatry before going back to the health technology route. I feel that my choice in the end was a better combination of my interests. Working with health technology is a mark I'd like to leave on this earth. To read more about my interests, you can visit <a href='interests.php'>here</a>.

      <!-- Future -->
      <h2 class='subtitle is-size-5 is-size-6-mobile is-family-code'>What I want from the future</h2>
      <p class='block is-size-5-widescreen is-size-6-desktop is-size-7-mobile has-text-left'>
        Right now I'm looking to build on my current technological expertise and slowly move towards seniority. I see multiple paths my career could take (ops, devops, development or any combination) and I am somewhat agnostic as to, which one is realized. At some point I would like to end up in the health technology industry, but I'm in no hurry and the current priority is my expertise. After reaching a level of seniority, I would like to start moving towards a management role.
